# FUNCTION TO FIND THE OPTIMAL NUMBER OF POINTS TO BE DRAWN
# BASED ON MAXIMIZING THE NUMBER OF PATCHES IN THE DESIRED SIZE RANGE
# the percentage of patches falling within the desired range is calculated a number of time (length.out) for different number of points (wide range)
# then a ternary search if performed to find the optimum

## PARAMETERS :

# mini_area / maxi_area = minimum and maximum bounds for desired patch size range
# type = c("random", "regular") for how points are drawn to perform the tesselation
# tol = default is 10, the tolerated error for the optimal search, i.e. when the search stops, when left and right search bounds are closer than tol. A measurement of accuracy, lower numbers means a longer and more accurate search, minimum possible is 1 
# bounds_min / bounds_max : min and max bounds of point numbers, range within which we search with a ternary search procedure for he optimum number of points, 
# i.e. the one that maximizes the number of patches (derived from points with a tesselation) which size falls within the desired range
# the default is bounds_min = 0.1, bounds_max=4, this means we will search for the optimum number of points between 0.1*theoretical number of points and  4* number of points
# length.out: number of points numbers for which the desired size range is calculated to search for the optimum - numbers of points are along a regular sequence between bounds_min*theoretical_number and bounds_max*theoretical_number, default is length.out = 10, it should be an integer. Note that increasing length.out will increase the accuracy of the search, but will also increase calculation time 
# rep: number of time the cutting and assessment is repeated for each element of the sequence (with length = length.out), default is repet = 1, it should be an integer, increasing this value will increase calculation time, but ~10 reps may help see if the process if variable or not
