# Patch-definition
Code to prepare biologically-meaning patch layers for ecological modeling, based on an initial habitat layer. For the manuscript: "Better defining habitat patches to improve spatially explicit modelling outputs Running title: Better modelling habitat patches"

This project contains three types of files: 
1- inputs.zip provides the example data, for which main code is applied, for you to test and understand how it works
2- main_patch.R is the main code to run our patch assessments and patch cutting procedure to better fit the biology of you study organism
3- fct_XX.R files provide the required functions to make main_patch.R run

Code produced in project ERC STG SCALED (GA no 949812).
